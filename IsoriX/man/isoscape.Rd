\title{Predicts the spatial distribution of source isotopic values}
\usage{
isoscape(raster, isofit, verbose = interactive())
}
\arguments{
\item{raster}{The structural raster (\var{RasterLayer}) such as an elevation
raster created using \code{\link{prepelev}}}

\item{isofit}{The fitted isoscape created by \code{\link{isofit}}}

\item{verbose}{A \var{logical} indicating whether information about the
progress of the procedure should be displayed or not while the function is
running. By default verbose is \var{TRUE} if users use an interactive R
session and \var{FALSE} otherwise.}
}
\value{
This function returns a \var{list} of class \var{ISOSCAPE} containing
a set of all 8 raster layers mentioned above (all being of class
\var{RasterLayer}), and the location of the sources as spatial points.
}
\description{
This function produces the set of isoscapes, i.e. the spatial prediction
(i.e. maps) of the distribution of source isotopic values, as well as several
variances around such predictions. The predictions are computed using the
fitted geostatistical models for each raster cell of a structural raster.
All shape files can be exported and loaded into any Geographic Information
System (GIS) if needed (see online tutorials).
}
\details{
This function computes the predictions (\code{mean}), prediction variances
(\code{mean_predVar}), residual variances (\code{mean_residVar}) and response
variances (\code{mean_respVar}) for the isotopic values at a resolution equal
to the one of the structural raster. It also computes the same information
for the residual dispersion variance (\code{disp_pred}, \code{disp_predVar},
\code{disp_residVar}, or \code{disp_respVar}).

The predictions of isotopic values across the landscape are performed by
calling the function \code{\link[spaMM]{predict}} from the package
\pkg{\link[spaMM]{spaMM}} on the fitted isoscape produced by
\code{\link{isofit}}.

Let us summarize the meaning of \code{mean}, \code{mean_predVar} and
\code{mean_respVar} (see Courtiol & Rousset 2017 for more details):

Our model assumes that that there is a single true unknown isoscape, which is
fixed but which is represented by the mixed-effect model as a random draw
from possible realizations of isoscapes (random draws of the
Matérn-correlated process and of the uncorrelated random effects if
considered). We infer this realized isoscape by fitting the model to a
limited amount of data, with some uncertainty since different random draws of
the unknown isoscape may give the same observed data. There is thus a
conditional distribution of possible true isoscapes given the data. For
linear mixed-effects models, the mean prediction is the mean of this
conditional distribution. The prediction variance is ideally the mean square
difference between the true unknown value of the linear predictor and the
mean prediction at a given location. The response variance has a different
meaning. It estimates the variance of new observations drawn from the true
unknown isoscape at a given location. The response variance is simply equal
to the sum of the prediction variance and the residual variance (note that
the residual variance considered assume that a single observation is being
observed per location).

The isoscape can be plotted using the function \code{\link{plot.ISOSCAPE}}
(see examples).

\examples{

## The examples below will only be run if sufficient time is allowed
## You can change that by typing e.g. options_IsoriX(example_maxtime = XX)
## if you want to allow for examples taking up to ca. XX seconds to run
## (so don't write XX but put a number instead!)

if(getOption_IsoriX("example_maxtime") > 30) {

## We prepare the data
GNIPDataDEagg <- prepsources(data = GNIPDataDE)

## We fit the models
GermanFit <- isofit(data = GNIPDataDEagg,
                    mean_model_fix = list(elev = TRUE, lat_abs = TRUE))

## We build the isoscapes
GermanScape <- isoscape(raster = ElevRasterDE, isofit = GermanFit)

GermanScape
plot(GermanScape)

## We build more plots
PlotMean <- plot(x = GermanScape, which = "mean", plot = FALSE)

PlotMeanPredVar <- plot(x = GermanScape, which = "mean_predVar", plot = FALSE)

PlotMeanResidVar <- plot(x = GermanScape, which = "mean_residVar", plot = FALSE)

PlotMeanRespVar <- plot(x = GermanScape, which = "mean_respVar", plot = FALSE)

## We display the plots
print(PlotMean, split = c(1, 1, 2, 2), more = TRUE)
print(PlotMeanPredVar,   split = c(2, 1, 2, 2), more = TRUE)
print(PlotMeanResidVar,  split = c(1, 2, 2, 2), more = TRUE)
print(PlotMeanRespVar,   split = c(2, 2, 2, 2), more = FALSE)
 
## We build a sphere with our isoscape
plot(x = GermanScape, which = "mean", plot = FALSE, sphere = list(build = TRUE))
 
## We can save a rotating sphere with the isoscape as a .gif-file.
## This file will be located inside your working directory.
## Make sure your current rgl device (from the previous step) is still open
## and that you have both the packages 'rgl' and 'magick' installed.
## The building of the .gif implies to create temporarily many .png
## but those will be removed automatically once the .gif is done.
if(interactive() & require("rgl") & require("magick")) {
