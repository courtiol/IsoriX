\description{
This dataset contains the hydrogen delta value from
precipitation water sampled at weather stations between 1961 and 2013 in
Germany. These data have been kindly provided by Christine Stumpp and
processed by the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA in Vienna (GNIP
Project: Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation). These data are free to
reuse provided the relevant citations (see references). These data represent
a small sample of the much larger dataset compiled by the GNIP. We no longer
provide larger GNIP dataset in the package as those are not free to reuse (but
we do provide aggregated versions of it; see [GNIPDataEUagg]).
You can still download the complete GNIP dataset for free, but you will have
to proceed to a registration process with GNIP and use their downloading
interface WISER (\url{https://nucleus.iaea.org/wiser/index.aspx}).
}
\details{
The dataset contains non-aggregated data for 27 weather stations across Germany.

This dataset is the raw data source and should not be directly used for
fitting isoscapes.

Please use [prepsources] to filter the dataset by time and
location.

If you want to use your own dataset, you must format your data as those
produced by the function [prepsources].
