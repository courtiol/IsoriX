\usage{
getprecip(path = NULL, overwrite = FALSE, verbose = interactive())
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A \var{string} indicating where to store the file on the hard
drive (without the file name!)}

\item{overwrite}{A \var{logical} indicating if an existing file should be
re-downloaded}

\item{verbose}{A \var{logical} indicating whether information about the
progress of the procedure should be displayed or not while the function is
running. By default verbose is \code{TRUE} if users use an interactive R
session and \code{FALSE} otherwise. If a \var{numeric} is provided instead,
additional information about the download will be provided if the number is
greater than 1.}

\description{
The function \code{getprecip} allows for the download of rasters of monthly
precipitation from internet. It downloads the "precipitation (mm) WorldClim
Version2" at a spatial resolution of 30 seconds (~1 km2). After download, the
function also unzip the file. The function
\code{getprecip} uses the generic function \code{downloadfile} that can also be
used to download directly other files. This raster needs further processing
with the function \code{\link{prepcipitate}}. It can then be used to predict
annual averages precipitation weighted isoscapes with the function \code{\link{isomultiscape}}.

\details{
precipitation weighted isoscapes
In the argument "path" is not provided, the file will be stored in the
current working directory. The functions can create new directories, so you
can also indicate a new path. The integrity of the elevation raster is tested
after a call to \code{getprecip}. In case of corruption, try downloading the
file again, specifying overwrite = TRUE to overwrite the corrupted file.

\examples{

## To download the monthly precipitation
## in your current working
## directory, just type:
## getprecip()
## Mind that the file weights ca. 1GB!
