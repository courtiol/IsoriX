}
\description{
This function fits the aggregated source data using mixed models. The fitting
procedures are done by the package \pkg{\link[spaMM]{spaMM}} which we use to
jointly fit the mean isotopic values and their associated residual dispersion
variance in a spatially explicit manner.
}
\details{
The detailed statistical definition of the isoscape model is described in
Courtiol & Rousset 2017.

Briefly, the fitting procedure of the isoscape model is divided into two
fits: \code{mean_fit} and \code{disp_fit}. \code{mean_fit} corresponds to the
fit of the "mean model", which we will use to predict the mean isotopic
values at any location in other functions of the package. \code{disp_fit}
corresponds to the fit of the "residual dispersion model", which we will use
to predict the residual dispersion variance associated to the mean
predictions. \code{mean_fit} is a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) with fixed
effects, an optional spatial random effect with a Matérn correlation
structure and an optional uncorrelated random effect accounting for variation
between sources unrelated to their location. \code{disp_fit} is a Gamma
Generalized LMM (Gamma GLMM) that also has fixed effects, an optional spatial
random effect with a Matérn correlation structure and an optional
uncorrelated random effect. For the GLMM the residual variance is fixed to
its theoretical expectation.

The \var{dataframe} \code{data} must contain a single row per source location
with the following columns: \code{mean_source_value} (the mean isotopic value),
\code{var_source_value} (the unbiased variance estimate of the isotopic value
at the location), \code{n_source_value} (the number of measurements performed
at the location, could be 1) and \code{source_ID} (a factor defining the
identity of the sources at a given location).

The arguments \code{mean_model_fix} and \code{disp_model_fix} allow the user
to choose among different fixed-effect structures for each model. These
arguments are lists of booleans (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}), which define
which of the following fixed effects must be considered: the elevation
(\code{elev}), the absolute value of the latitude (\code{lat_abs}), the
squared latitude (\code{lat_2}), the longitude (\code{long}) and the squared
longitude (\code{long_2}). An intercept is always considered in both models.

In the models, the mean (for the mean model) or the log residual variance
(for the residual dispersion model) follow a Gaussian distribution around a
constant value. The arguments \code{mean_model_rand} and
\code{disp_model_rand} allow to choose among different random effects for
each model influencing the realizations of these Gaussian random processes.
For each model one can choose not to include random effects or to include an
uncorrelated random effect, a spatial random effect, or both (default).
Setting \code{"uncorr" = TRUE} implies that the realizations of the random
effect differ between sources for reasons that have nothing to do with the
relative geographic location (e.g. some micro-climate or some measurement
errors trigger a shift in all measurements (mean model) or a shift in the
variance between measurements (residual dispersion model) performed at a
given source by the same amount). Setting \code{"spatial" = TRUE} (default)
implies that the random realizations of the Gaussian process follow a Matérn
correlation structure. Put simply, this implies that the closer two locations
are, the more similar the means (or the log residual variance) in isotopic
values are (e.g. because they are likely to be traversed by the same air
masses).

The arguments \code{uncorr_terms} allow the choice between two alternative
parameterizations for the uncorrelated random effect in the fits:
\code{"lambda"} or \code{"nugget"} for each model. When using
\code{"lambda"}, the variance of the uncorrelated random terms is classically
modeled by a variance. When a spatial random effect is considered, one can
alternatively choose \code{"nugget"}, which modifies the Matérn correlation
value when distance between location tends to zero. If no random effect is
considered, one should stick to the default setting and it will be ignored by
the function. The choice of the parametrization is a matter of personal
preferences and it does not change the underlying models, so the estimations
for all the other parameters of the models should not be impacted by whether
one chooses \code{"lambda"} or \code{"nugget"}. However, only uncertainty in
the estimation of \code{"lambda"} can be accounted for while computing
prediction variances, which is why we chose this alternative as the default.
Depending on the data one parametrization may lead to faster fit than the
other.

The argument \code{spaMM_method} is also a list of two \var{strings} where
the first element defines the spaMM functions used for fitting the mean model
and the second element defines the spaMM method used for fitting the residual
dispersion model. The possible options are "HLfit", "corrHLfit" and "fitme".
Note that "HLfit" shall only be used in the absence of a Matérn correlation
structure and "corrHLfit" shall only be used in the presence of it. In
contrast, "fitme" should work in all situations. Which method is best remains
to be determined and it is good practice to try different methods (if
applicable) to check for the robustness of the results. If all is well one
should obtain very similar results with the different methods. If this is not
the case, carefully check the model output to see if one model fit did not
get stuck at a local minimum during optimization (which would translate in a
lower likelihood, or weird isoscapes looking flat with high peaks at very
localised locations).

The argument \code{dist_method} allows modifying how the distance between
locations is computed to estimate the spatial correlation structure. By
default, we consider the so-called "Earth" distances which are technically
called orthodromic distances. They account for earth curvature. The
alternative "Euclidean" distances do not. For studies performed on a small
geographic scale, both distance methods should lead to similar results.

The arguments \code{control_mean} and \code{control_dist} are lists that are
transmitted to the \pkg{\link[spaMM]{spaMM}} fitting functions (defined by
\code{spaMM_method}). These lists can be used to finely control the fitting
procedure, so advanced knowledge of the package \pkg{\link[spaMM]{spaMM}} is
required before messing around with these inputs.

We highly recommend users to examine the output produced by \code{isofit}.
Sometimes, poor fit may occur and such models should therefore not be used
for building isoscapes or performing assignments.
}
\note{
There is no reason to restrict \code{mean_fit} and \code{disp_fit} to
  using the same parametrization for fixed and random effects.

  Never use a mean_fit object to draw predictions without considering a
  disp_fit object: mean_fit is not fitted independently from disp_fit.

  For all methods, fixed effects are being estimated by Maximum Likelihood
  (ML) and dispersion parameters (i.e. random effects and Matern correlation
  parameters) are estimated by Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML). Using
  REML provides more accurate prediction intervals but impedes the accuracy
  of Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT). Our choice for REML was motivated by the
  fact that our package is more likely to be used for drawing inferences than
  null hypothesis testing. Users interested in model comparisons may rely on
  the conditional AIC values that can be extracted from fitted models using
  the function \code{\link[spaMM:extractors]{AIC}} from
  \pkg{\link[spaMM]{spaMM}}.

  Variable names for \code{data} must be respected to ensure a correct
  utilization of this package. Alteration to the fixed effect structure is
  not implemented so far (beyond the different options proposed) to avoid
  misuse of the package. Users that would require more flexibility should
  consider using spaMM directly (see Courtiol & Rousset 2017) or let us know
  which other covariates would be useful to add in IsoriX.
