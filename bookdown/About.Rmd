# About this book

We wrote this documentation in R Markdown and built it using the R package [**`bookdown`**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

You can check what has changed since the last time you read it using GitHub.
For example, this information for the page you are reading right now is available [here](https://github.com/courtiol/IsoriX/blame/main/bookdown/About.Rmd).

All the R code used to compile this bookdown ran within the following R session:

```{r R session}
sessionInfo()
```
