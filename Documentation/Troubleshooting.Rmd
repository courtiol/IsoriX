## I cannot install Cairo but I need to save my plots {-}

If you really don't manage to use _Cairo_ (or if you don't want to use it), you can always use the simple out-of-the-box alternative offered by R.
You just need to use different function calls corresponding to the one we described in section \@ref(Cairo):

* `CairoPNG()` --> `png()`

* `CairoPDF()` --> `pdf()`

Nothing else changes, the inputs should be the same and you still need to close the graphic device using `dev.off()` after ploting.
