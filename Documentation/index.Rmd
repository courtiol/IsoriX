# Work in progress! {-}

This new documentation of the R package _IsoriX_ which aims at replacing the former vignettes and will ultimately provide much more information than before.
The chapters 1 to 4 are now almost complete but you will have to wait for a couple of weeks for the other main chapter to follow. For the time being please directly refer to the documentation of the package:

```{r get help}
help("IsoriX") ## for the general description
help(package = "IsoriX") ## for the links to all the help files of the package
```

PS: for this to work you must have installed the package before (see section \@ref(installation)).


```{r image_intro, fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics('images/isoscape.png', dpi = NA)
```
